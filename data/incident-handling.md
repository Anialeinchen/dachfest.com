## Code of Conduct Incident Handling Guidelines

We believe that having a strict Code of Conduct helps build welcoming, inclusive, and diverse communities. Unfortunately, despite having a Code of Conduct that everyone agrees to, incidents do happen, and when they do, you should make sure that you stay respectful and attentive when taking a report and investigating an incident.

1. **Read and understand the CoC documents.** There are two, not including the one you are reading now: [the Code of Conduct itself]() and [the violation reporting guidelines for attendees]().

2. **Be respectful, professional, and polite.** The victim has experienced a traumatic event and may not feel comfortable with the interview. Your immediate task is to:

* introduce yourself; 
* express regret that the violation took place;
* assure the victim of their immediate safety;
* assure the victim that everything possible and reasonable will be done to maintain that safety, as well as the safety of the other attendees;
* convince the victim of the competence and experience of the response team.

3. **Provide a safe space.** Use one of the extra rooms at the venue or a staff room. Make sure the victim is comfortable with the setting: some people may be more comfortable with a private place, while some would prefer to stay in public. Make sure the victim is comfortable with you as an interviewer: they might prefer, for example, an interviewer of a different gender.

4. **Remember that an interview is not an interrogation.** The victim has agreed to be interviewed, which means they want to cooperate and have faith in your abilities. Consequently, it is recommended that the following factors be adhered to during the interview phase:

* Involve the victim in the interview process. Ask for their opinions throughout the interview. Provide them with your contact details to be able to follow up on the investigation, or advise them that you will periodically contact them to keep them informed.
* Allow the victim as much control as possible. Ask how they would like to be addressed; do not assume gender or pronouns. Ask if they would prefer to describe the violation in their own words or if they would rather you ask questions. Determine if they want anyone contacted.
* Listen and respond to their wishes and requests if at all possible.

4. **Try to get all details of the incident.** The important information to gather includes:

* Identifying information (name on the badge or physical appearance) of the offending party.
* Identifying information (name on the badge or physical appearance) of the victim or victims.
* Detailed description of the violating behavior.
* Place of the incident. 
* Approximate time of the incident.
* Circumstances surrounding the incident.
* Other people involved in (or witnessing) the incident.

5. **Reassure the victim.** Most of the time, submitting a violation report takes courage and resolve. Be aware of how much effort the victim has put in, and thank them sincerely. Explain the procedures that will follow, and make sure the victim understands that everything possible will be done to resolve the incident. Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the incident and do not offer a choice of penalty: this is the responsibility of the response team and the conference chairs, and it should not fall on the victim's shoulders.

7. **Submit the report to conduct@dachfest.com.** This is an essential step to keep all reports written down, stored in one place, and available to the entire response team. Add your notes if necessary. Even if the reporter couldn't provide identifying information of the participant doing the harassing, the incident should be submitted in order to have as much information in case the same incident is reported again.

8. **Meet with the response team.** The main objectives of this meeting is to decide and make everyone aware of the following:

* What has been reported?
* Who is responsible for further incident handling?
* When is it going to be handled?
* What is the appropriate measure if the report stands?

9. **(Response team only) Communicate with the alleged harasser.** Make sure to inform them of what has been reported about them. Allow the alleged harasser to give their side of the story to the staff. If they wish to appeal, the appeals should be submitted to conduct@dachfest.com. **Do not disclose the names of the victim or the reporter.**

10. **(Response team only) Decide on the actions to be taken against the alleged harasser and notify them.** As a member of the response team, the choice of action is at your full discretion. Possible sanctions against code of conduct violators include (but are not limited to):

* Warning the harasser to cease their behavior and warning that any further reports will result in stricter sanctions.
* Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with — and physical proximity to — their victim for the remainder of the event.
* Immediately ending a violating speaker's talk.
* Not publishing the video or slides of a violating talk.
* Banning a violating speaker from further speaking engagements at DACHFest events.
* Immediately ending a violating volunteer's responsibilities and privileges.
* Banning a violating volunteer from volunteering at future events.
* Requiring that the violator refund any grants, scholarships, or similar aid they have received.
* Requiring that the violator immediately leave the event.
* Banning the violator from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period).
* Removing the violator from relevant organizations or groups (GDG, WTM, and similar).
* Publishing an account of the harassment.

11. **Make the parties involved aware of the resolution.** This includes the victim, the reporter, and any witnesses that have come into contact with you. You should not disclose investigation details, but you should notify everyone of the particular measure or measures taken.

12. **(Conference chairs only) Decide on whether to make a public announcement.** Depending on the incident, the conference chairs may decide to make public announcements. No one other than the conference chairs should make any public statements about the violation. No personal information about the victim or the reporter should be disclosed as part of this process unless there is explicit consent, and no personal information about the violator should be disclosed unless the violator has been notified that the sanctions against the violation will include a public statement.

13. **(Response team only) Include the incident in the transparency report.** A means to submit information for the transparency report will be provided during the conference.
