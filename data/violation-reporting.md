## First Things First

We believe that having a strict Code of Conduct helps build welcoming, inclusive, and diverse communities. Unfortunately, despite having a Code of Conduct that everyone agrees to, incidents do happen, and when they do, having a clear set of guidelines for reporting and handling them helps us resolve problematic situations in a better way.

This page will provide guidelines on how to help us resolve incidents quickly, efficiently, and, hopefully, to everyone's satisfaction.

However, most importantly, **you don't have to read this.** While it may help us, if you're too shook up or stressed out by an incident, reading a long document and compiling an accurate report may not be something you are capable of. We are ready to help you: just find the nearest staff member or reach out by email at conduct@dachfest.com.

**All reports are confidential.** The only people who will have access to your report are: the person you have submitted the report to; the incident response team, which is directly responsible for handling such occurrences; the conference chairs in case the report is escalated.

## What to Report

**Remember that Code of Conduct applies to everyone.** Attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, organizers, venue staff â€” literally anyone you might see on the conference grounds is bound by our CoC, and you should report all violations you see.

**The violation doesn't have to be directed at you to report it.** If you see someone else being harrassed, or if you witness inappropriate behavior that doesn't target anyone in particular, you still can (and should) report it.

## Where to Report

**Any member of our staff can receive a violation report.** If you see or hear anyone break the CoC, we are kindly asking you to find the strength to report it to any member of our staff (can be identified by special badges or attire). Every volunteer and organizer is trained to take reports, which will then be forwarded to our incident response team immediately. You can also submit your report to **[conduct@dachfest.com](mailto:conduct@dachfest.com)**. During the conference hours, you should receive an acknowledgement within 30-60 minutes.

**If you believe that someone may not be physically safe, contact law enforcement.** Dial 110. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any phone at the venue or ask a staff member.

## How to report

**Gather as much information as you can without interviewing people.** Interviewing the person or people affected about the incident is something that is better handled by people specifically trained to do it, and we are kindly asking you to leave it to our response team. However, a lot of useful information can be gathered without direct interviews:

* Identifying information (name on the badge or physical appearance) of the offending party.
* Identifying information of the victim or victims.
* Detailed description of the violating behavior.
* Place of the incident.
* Approximate time of the incident.
* Circumstances surrounding the incident.
* Other people involved in (or witnessing) the incident.

**Allow the response team to address the violation before further disclosure.** While we believe that all incidents have to be called out, a hot public debate surronding a violation may interfere with the work of our response team and may not be desirable for the person or people affected. As such, we are asking for an opportunity to address the violation before you make it public.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community, and they will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. The DACHFest staff kindly asks that they be your first resource when reporting an incident, so that they may enforce the Code of Conduct and take swift action towards a resolution.
