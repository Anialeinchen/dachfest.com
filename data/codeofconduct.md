## Introduction

DACHFest is a community-driven conference for developers of all level of experience and background.

As a community-driven conference, we want everybody to feel welcome, regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, disabilites or physical appearance. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any DevFest Berlin event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

The very short version of this Code of Conduct is "Don't be a dick". The following Code of Conduct explains what this means in detail.

## The short version

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for DACHFest.

If you notice that someone is being harassed, do not hesitate to contact the conference organizers or volunteers wearing a t-shirt with the word **"STAFF"** on it (or otherwise marked as staff) to report the incident. While we do our best to notice any case of harassment, we rely on your help as a coference attendee to report any incident. The complete procedure to report incidents can be found here:

# TODO: Update those links!

[Incident handling procedure for organizers/staff](data/incident-handling-staff.md)

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## The longer version

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for DACHFest.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
