### Topics 💭

DACHFest is a community-driven conference open to all technologies. We are happy to hear about any topics you might think of! That includes, but is not limited to:
  
📱 Mobile (Android, iOS, Firebase, Machine Learning, ...)  
💻 Web (Polymer, PWAs, Angular, Dart, new standards, tooling, ...)  
☁️ Cloud (TensorFlow, big data, Kubernetes, security, ...)  
📟 IoT (Android Things, Actions API, Android Wear, Chromecast, Arduino, ...)  
🌏 Science (physics, universe, space travel, future, ...)  
💼 Marketing & business skills targeted at indie developers or startups  
🙋 Soft skills for developers

To give you a better idea of what topics were talked about before, take a look at the sessions from the following DevFests:

* [GDG DevFest Hamburg 2017](https://hamburg.devfest.de/schedule/day1)
* [GDG DevFest Ukraine 2017](https://dfua17.firebaseapp.com/schedule/day1)

In general, we are not looking for repetition of any existing documentation, articles or talks, but rather for experiences and learnings you made. 

### Selection Process

TODO!

### Guidelines 📃

- Language: all talks are in English.
- Formatting: make sure you care, and make sure we see you care. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase submissions make our reading of your proposal tedious and will reflect negatively on the outcome of your submission.
- Brevity: don’t get too wordy. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your proposal, we ask you to put more time into focussing your application. With the amount of submissions we get, the quicker you can make a good first impression, the better.
- We are not looking for talks that were recorded before or given to an audience bigger than 200 people. You don't need to submit a completely new talk, but could for example add a twist or new part to a pre-existing talk.
- Your Abstract should not be longer than 1200 characters

### Talk Formats 🗣️
   
We are looking for two types of sessions: 
    - Full-length talks, 35 mins + Q&A 
    - Lightning talks, 15 mins + Q&A 

We are open to any proposals for different formats. 

### Support 👩‍💻
    
Nobody is a born presenter. If you are here reading this CfP, you probably want to speak. We are here to give you all the support you might need. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things we can help you with: 
   
* Finding a talk topic
* Writing an abstract
* Preparing your submission with experienced speakers 
* Producing your slides 
* Public speaking training, including (remote) rehearsal
* Contact with local meetups to practice your talk in front of a smaller crowd 

If you need any other help, contact us via Twitter or [cfp@dachfest.com](mailto:cfp@dachfest.com) and we'll be happy to help!

### Travel Reimbursement ✈️🚆
If you need to be compensated for your travel, please note so when submitting your talk, including an estimate for flight/train and hotel. While we can't offer travel support to everyone, we'll do our best to find a solution.
   
If your employer can cover your travel and hotel, we’ll be happy to mention them as a company sponsor or partner (you can state that on the last page of this form). The money we save will be invested into the general running of the conference and scholarships for attendees from underrepresented groups or students.  Entry to the conference: as a speaker, you will get two free tickets: one for you and another person. Please note that we may not be done with the speaker selections by the time tickets go on sale, so if you want to make sure you can attend, let us know in the form below and we’ll hold a ticket for you in case your talk is not selected.
 
### Video Recordings 🎥
In order to make content presented at DACHFest accessible for everybody in the community, we plan to record all talks along with the slides or any on-screen content and publish them for free. If you are not happy with the way your talk went or are uncomfortable with being recorded, tell us in the *Notes* section when submitting your talk or afterwards at the conference and we will work things out. 
   
Finally, since you retain full ownership of your slides and recording, we’d like to ask you to make your materials and recording available under a Creative Commons (we default to non-commercial reuse) or any other open source license. 

### Code of Conduct 
We aim to make DACHFest harassment-free and as inclusive as possible. We need you to read, understand and comply with our [Code of Conduct](/coc).
